PayPal REST API issues
======================

Use this repo to track PayPal REST API-related issues.

This repo tracks issues that were previously tracked as server issues in the [PayPal SDK and plugin repos](#paypal-sdk-and-plugin-repos). 

Each issue reports a REST API bug, documentation update, or new feature. To learn when to [file issues](#file-issues) and how [issues are labeled](#issue-labels), read the following topics.

## File issues

Before you file an issue, search this repo for any existing issues that report your same issue. To file an issue, complete the [issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) with as many details as possible.

## Issue labels

After issues are triaged, each issue is labeled with a minimum of two labels, as follows:

| Label | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| **bug**, **feature**, **dev-docs**, or **dev-dashboard** label | Indicates whether the issue reports a bug, documentation update, or new feature. |
| One or more API labels | The API or APIs with the issue. |
